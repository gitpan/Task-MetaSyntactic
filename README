Task-MetaSyntactic

DESCRIPTION

Acme::MetaSyntactic is a module designed to fill all your metasyntactic
needs. There was a weekly update with new themes on CPAN between January
15, 2005 and November 6, 2006.

On May 7, 2012, after a hiatus of five and a half years,
Acme::MetaSyntactic came back, in a shiny version 1.000.
The main "Acme-MetaSyntactic" distribution contains the core modules
and a single theme, while all "historical" themes now live in the
"Acme-MetaSyntactic-Themes" distribution.

The Test::MetaSyntactic module included in the main distribution aims at
simplifying the test and distribution of new themes by individual authors.

This Task installs all the official and not-so-official
Acme::MetaSyntactic themes.
